# Installation
Guerrilla can run both in Windows and Linux.

## Installation: Windows
Most testers' operating environment is to use the Window System. The friendly operation interface reduces the configuration environment threshold. Do not need to operate a difficult command interface. At the same time, it also depends on VMWare or Virtualbox.

### Requirements
To run Guerrilla in Windows, we first need to have an available
virtual machine system, which Guerrilla will use to interact with DUTs.

- [VMWare Workstation 15+](https://www.vmware.com/tw/products/workstation-pro/workstation-pro-evaluation.html) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- [Vagrant](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads?product_intent=vagrant)

### Installation
We will install Rig using Helm. We enable the MongoDB single instance which
is shipped with the helm chart.


## Installation: Linux
