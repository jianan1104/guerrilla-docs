# Installation for Linux

## Requirements
To running Guerrilla we first need to have an available
virtual machine system, which Guerrilla will use to interact with DUTs.

- 3+ Physical Network Interface 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/) and [KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page)
- [Vagrant 2.2.5+](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads?product_intent=vagrant)
- [vagrant-libvirt](https://vagrant-libvirt.github.io/vagrant-libvirt/)


## Install QEMU/KVM

### Check Virtualization Enabled 

```bash
$ egrep -c '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

If Virtualization is supported, the output should be greater than 0, for example, 2,4,6, etc.

Alternatively, you can run the following grep command to display the type of processor your system supports. In our case, we are running Intel VT-x denoted by the vmx parameter.

```bash
$ grep -E --color '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo
```

Equally important, check if KVM virtualization is supported by running the following command:

```bash
$ kvm-ok
INFO: /dev/kvm exists
KVM acceleration can be used
```

If the kvm-ok utility is missing, install the cpu-checker package as follows.
```bash
$ sudo apt install cpu-checker -y
```

Now that we have verified that our system supports KVM virtualization, let us proceed and install QEMU.

### Install QEMU/KVM

Next up, update the package lists and repositories as follows.

```bash
$ sudo apt update
```
Thereafter, install QEMU/KVM alongside other virtualization packages as follows:

```bash
$ sudo apt install qemu-kvm virt-manager virtinst libvirt-clients bridge-utils libvirt-daemon-system -y
```

Let us examine what role each of these packages plays.

- qemu-kvm – This is an open-source emulator that emulates the hardware resources of a computer.
- virt-manager – A Qt-based GUI interface for creating and managing virtual machines using the libvirt daemon.
- virtinst – A collection of command-line utilities for creating and making changes to virtual machines.
- libvirt-clients – APIs and client-side libraries for managing virtual machines from the command line.
- bridge-utils – A set of command-line tools for managing bridge devices.
- libvirt-daemon-system – Provides configuration files needed to run the virtualization service.
At this point, we have installed QEMU and all the essential virtualization packages. The next step is to start and enable the libvirtd virtualization daemon.

So, run the following commands:

```bash
$ sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
$ sudo systemctl start libvirtd
```

Next, verify if the virtualization service is running as shown.

```bash
$ sudo systemctl status libvirtd
● libvirtd.service - Virtualization daemon
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/libvirtd.service; enabled; vendor pres>
     Active: active (running) since Fri 2023-09-01 09:52:10 CST; 1 week 0 days >
TriggeredBy: ● libvirtd.socket
             ● libvirtd-admin.socket
             ● libvirtd-ro.socket
       Docs: man:libvirtd(8)
             https://libvirt.org
   Main PID: 953 (libvirtd)
      Tasks: 27 (limit: 32768)
     Memory: 94.8M
        CPU: 1min 15.437s
     CGroup: /system.slice/libvirtd.service
             ├─ 953 /usr/sbin/libvirtd
             ├─1297 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/defa>
             ├─1298 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/defa>
             ├─1345 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/vagr>
             └─1346 /usr/sbin/dnsmasq --conf-file=/var/lib/libvirt/dnsmasq/vagr>
```

From the output above, the libvirtd daemon is up and running as expected. Additionally, add the currently logged-in user to the kvm and libvirt groups as shown.

```bash
$ sudo usermod -aG kvm $USER
$ sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER
```

### Launch Virtual Machine Manager 

The next step is to launch the QEMU/KVM GUI tool which is the Virtual Machine Manager.

```bash
$ sudo virt-manager
```

The Virtual Machine Manager will pop up as shown. From here, you can start creating and managing virtual machines as we shall demonstrate shortly.

Good, you have **FREE** VMWare Workstation Pro now!

## Install Vagrant

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Ubuntu/Debian" label="Ubuntu/Debian">

```bash
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install vagrant
```

</TabItem>


<TabItem value="CentOS/RHEL" label="CentOS/RHEL">

```bash
sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/RHEL/hashicorp.repo
sudo yum -y install vagrant
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Homebrew" label="Homebrew">

```bash
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/vagrant
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the installation, turn on the terminal and test whether the Vagrant operates normally

```plain
$ vagrant

Usage: vagrant [options] <command> [<args>]

    -h, --help                       Print this help.

Common commands:
     autocomplete    manages autocomplete installation on host
     box             manages boxes: installation, removal, etc.
     cloud           manages everything related to Vagrant Cloud
     destroy         stops and deletes all traces of the vagrant machine
     global-status   outputs status Vagrant environments for this user
     halt            stops the vagrant machine
     help            shows the help for a subcommand
     init            initializes a new Vagrant environment by creating a Vagrantfile
     login           
     mutate          
     ...
```

It looks all great.
