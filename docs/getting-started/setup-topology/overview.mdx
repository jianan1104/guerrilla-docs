:::info
We need at least three NIC for the testbed. One is for executor to access the DUT and the other two are for simulating the traffic.
Totally we have three subnet:
- Control Subnet: Itâ€™s for the communication between executor, host1 and host2.
(192.168.118.0/24)
- RD Network Subnet: Control Subnet (192.168.118.0/24) will be translated to 10.123.39.0
- Testbed Subnet: LAN or WAN subnet (192.168.127.0/24, 192.168.128..0/24) will be set if the test requires.
